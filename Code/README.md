# Code


The basic Python module `qtda_module.py` contains the base classes generating the quantum circuit of the QTDA-algorithm as well as the data filtration of point data. It builds on the libraries **IBM Qiskit** library (https://github.com/Qiskit) for quantum computing and **GUHDI** (https://github.com/GUDHI) for classical TDA.

The [Jupyter-Notebook](https://github.com/KathrinKoenig/QuantumTopologicalDataAnalysis/blob/main/Code/Introductory_notebook.ipynb) explain basic functionalities of the algorithm and the filtration of simplicial complexes describing topological and geometric features of the data points on different scales.
