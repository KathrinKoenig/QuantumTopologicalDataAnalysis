Implementation of a quantum algorithm to compute topological features of generic (high-dimensional) data clouds in Qiskit.

Topological and geometric features of data are of increasing interest in data analysis to "understand" data and provide complementary global information for modern machine learning pipelines. Therefore, we implement a quantum algorithm to compute such topological features of data clouds, which yields exponential speed-up over all known classical algorithms.

We implement a topological algorithm (https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3106) on Qiskit to calculate persistent spectra (and from it Betti numbers) of simplicial complexes representing arbitrary (high-dimensional) data. The algorithm builds on the phase estimation algorithm. After successful implementation we apply the algorithm to real datasets on IBM quantum backends.

## How does TDA work?
As an example TDA is applied to a simple point cloud as shown below.

On this point cloud a filtration is done by expanding spheres with radius Îµ.

Points are connected for overlapping spheres.

This changes the topology of the data.
